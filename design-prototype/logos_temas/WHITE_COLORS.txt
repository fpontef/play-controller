Other colors or words that represent hues that are white or almost white include snow, milk, ivory, pearl, paper, corn silk, seashell, linen, cream and alabaster.

Create contrast: Choose dark or bright colors that will speak to users against
the white background. Black is a common choice for type on a white background
(dark grays as well) because it is easy to see and read. The same is true of
images as well. Select images that aren’t overly white in focus or consider
using a black border around images to set them apart from the stark
background.

Keep it simple: The essence of white is simplicity. For the most impact, opt
for a simple or minimally-styled design scheme.

Use simple images: Photos, graphics and illustrations should mirror the same
feel as the overall design. Rather than complex images with a lot going on,
keep them simple as well.

Focus on typography: Beautiful type is of the upmost importance in a design
outline where everything is simple. This also makes type more of a foal point
in the overall design. Pick one or two great fonts and use them well. This
will go a long way to creating a visually stunning white-based website.

Space is your friend: Remember, white backgrounds are part of an overall look
and trend. Use them well by giving everything on the screen plenty of room.
Add extra space around objects, leave wider margins between text and menu
items. Try to focus on the space as much as the objects within it.

Focus on an accent color: Pick a color and use it against white backgrounds
and black type for a fun. The “pop of color” brings focus to certain parts of
the design in a more subtle way. And it works with almost any hue.
